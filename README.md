This file is made for testing LRU cache with respect to Pattern-based Caching

      Performance Comparison between LRU and Pattern-based Application Usage Model : 
  
  The objective of this paper was to prove that Pattern based caching algorithm improves the performance of application launching than the LRU algorithm implemented on a smartphone device.Implementation of pattern based stack optimization module that makes use of usage patterns in optimizing the performance of the stack. The simulations determined that pattern based application usage model has 54.7% more chance of avoiding application reboots than that of LRU policy boosting launching performance.Language used:Python. Tools:adb,logcat.

The algorithm has O(n square) complexity as it reiterates through the doubly linked list.
